## Commentary:
## The most probable values in both plots are around 6-9 heads
## Each plot looks similar but they share a similarity of
## every graph having zero frequency for certain numbers of heads,
## as if every trial does not have any number of heads for those
## specific values that are absent from the graphs
## Weirdly, in the N = 100,000 plot, the most probable value for the Poisson 
## distribution coincides with the area of the coinflip graph where there is 
## zero frequency. Very strange. There is a big gap right where the highest
## frequency number of heads should be.

## Commentary:
# Before graphing the wait times distribution, I thought that the distribution would unevenly lean to the right,
# with a higher frequency of medium-long waiting times in between coin flips that result in heads
# since there is a lower probability of getting heads than tails for this unfair coin.
# But the histogram gave me the exact opposite: the graph leans towards the left, with a higher frequency of relatively
# shorter wait times, with the highest frequency wait times being between 0 and 5 seconds.

# Loglog does not look like any clear distribution pattern that I am familiar with

## Commentary:
# The patterns for what these distributions look like (N = 100,000) are similar to those 
# for the N = 1000 case, i.e. semilog looks like it is oscillating, and the same is true here,
# only for the semilog plot, the oscilation is much more condensed since the x-range
# now goes from 0 to 10^4 and the vertical range only goes from 0 to 10^2
